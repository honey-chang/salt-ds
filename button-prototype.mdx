# Button

## Overview

<!--
  Live component demo here of the default/most common usage.

  For live demos in Storybook use:

  <Canvas>
    <Story id="..." />
  </Canvas>
-->

A Button executes an action when clicked. Button labels should use only one or two words and begin with an active verb. There are three Button variants:
- Call-To-Action (a.k.a. CTA) performs a critical action on the screen.
- Primary is the most commonly-used button.
- Secondary performs an action less likely to be triggered.

## Configurations

<!--
  A visual list of possible configurations of the component.

  The purpose is to convey the main features and/or usage options of the
  component (e.g. the Data Grid's striped rows might be a "configuration" to
  showcase here). The configurations listed here should aim to be comprehensive,
  but not necessarily exhaustive (some complex components may have vast numbers
  of possible permutations, so listing out each one would be impossible and
  overwhelming to readers).

  Each confguration should have its own section following the structure outlined
  below:
-->

### Button with icon and label

Icons can be put before or after text, or used alone. Check the Accessibility section for guidance on ensuring your Button remains accessible to all.
 - An icon should be put before the text if it is further describing the button's action, such as 'Upload', 'Submit', 'Play', or 'Done'. This can be useful in busy environments where an additional description can improve speed in locating actions.
- When you put an icon after the button label, it typically suggests direction or movement, such as opening a menu overlay, expanding a panel or opening a document. In this case, when the button is pressed there is typically an immediate visual change.
- A button with only an icon and no text should be self-explanatory, ideally using well-known metaphors which are easily related to. If the purpose of the button isn’t clear, a label should be added. If space is a consideration, add a tooltip to the button set to display on hover after a short delay (typically 300ms, --salt-delay-perceptible). The tooltip should add context to the action such as 'Edit this form', 'Print this document', or 'Lock document state'.

  source code.

  In Storybook this is done using something like:

  <Canvas>
    <Story id="..." />
  </Canvas>
-->

### Disabled Button

A Button where the `disabled` prop has been set to `true`. This will suppress all functionality associated with the Button, along with disabling the Button. If you need a disabled Button to be focusable, you also need to pass focusableWhenDisabled="true".


## Usage

### When to use Button

<!-- Bulleted list of scenarios in which this component can be used  -->

- You want to indicate actions that the user can take.
- The navigation is the core action on the page. In this case, a CTA Button should be used to trigger the navigation.

### When not to use Button

<!--
  Bulleted list of scenarios where this component is not appropriate. Where
  possible, include a link to an alternative component that should be used in
  it's place
-->

The Button navigates the user to a new page or window rather than triggering a function, in that case a Link component is more appropriate.

### Accessibility

<!--
  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  Describe any considerations the users may need to take into account when using
  the component. For example:

  - Accessibility decisions that deviate from industry standard. (e.g., we've
    introduced an arrow key navigation, where usually is only tab).
  - Accessibility requirements that drive design (e.g., how multi-column forms
    should wrap).
  - Best practices regarding accessible content (e.g., error message
    announcements must not rely on descriptions that require the user to
    visually or audibly perceive content).
  - Best practices regarding implementation (e.g., to make sure this component
    is accessible be sure to provide a relevant alt text).
-->

If you are using icons contained inside Button:

- Pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to the icon so its label is not announced by the screen reader.
- If the only content is an icon, you should pass an aria-label to Button that describes its purpose.
 
## Styling

### Anatomy

<!--
  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.
 
  A visual anatomy diagram that shows the key parts or nested components that
  this component is made up of. They should be annotated with numbered badges in
  the diagram and a numbered list below the image should provide the names or
  explanations for each part.
-->

![Text alternative for component anatomy diagram](./path/to/anatomy.jpg)
 
1. Description of item in the anatomy badged with #1
2. Description of item in the anatomy badged with #2
3. ...
 
### Additional materials

<!--
  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  Add a bulleted list of links to additional, component-specific materials.
  Note that only publicly accessible pages can be linked to.
