# Tooltip

## Overview

<!--

  Live component demo here of the default/most common usage.

  For live demos in Storybook use:

  <Canvas>

    <Story id="..." />

  </Canvas>

-->

A Tooltip provides guidance to the user when something requires more explanation or context, or to provide more information about an error or warning condition. A Tooltip will typically be displayed after the userâ€™s mouse hovers over the target element for a certain amount of time.

## Configurations

<!--

  A visual list of possible configurations of the component.

  The purpose is to convey the main features and/or usage options of the

  component (e.g. the Data Grid's striped rows might be a "configuration" to

  showcase here). The configurations listed here should aim to be comprehensive,

  but not necessarily exhaustive (some complex components may have vast numbers

  of possible permutations, so listing out each one would be impossible and

  overwhelming to readers).

  Each configuration should have its own section following the structure outlined

  below:

-->

### Status

You can use the `status` prop to add a status icon to your tooltip. Choose between `error`, `warning`, `success` and `info`. By default, the tooltip uses an `info` icon

<!--

  A live example of the component configuration, with access to the corresponding

  source code.

  In Storybook this is done using something like:

  <Canvas>

    <Story id="..." />

  </Canvas>

-->

### Hide arrow

To display the tooltip without the arrow linking it to the onscreen element, use the `hideArrow` prop.

<!--

  source code.

  In Storybook this is done using something like:

  <Canvas>

    <Story id="..." />

  </Canvas>

-->

### Hide icon

To display the tooltip without a state icon, use the `hideIcon` prop.

<!--

  source code.

  In Storybook this is done using something like:

  <Canvas>

    <Story id="..." />

  </Canvas>

-->

### Custom content

Using the `content` prop you can pass a simple string, or a React component to be displayed in the tooltip.

<!--

  In Storybook this is done using something like:

  <Canvas>

    <Story id="..." />

  </Canvas>

-->

### Placement

Use the `placement` prop to position the tooltip. The tooltip will flip and shift if there isn't enough space for it to be visible.

  In Storybook this is done using something like:

### Delay before shown

By default, the tooltip displays after the on-screen element is hovered over for 300ms. Use the `enterDelay` prop to change the delay before the tooltip is shown

## Usage

### When not to use Tooltip

<!--

  Bulleted list of scenarios where this component is not appropriate. Where

  possible, include a link to an alternative component that should be used in

  it's place

-->

- Do not place information required by the user to complete a task inside a tooltip. Any important help text should remain visible on screen at all times, not just when a tooltip is displayed.

### Content

Content within tooltips should be supplementary information that provides succinct and descriptive clarity to the user. 

### Accessibility

We do not recommend that you include interactive elements within a tooltip as this is inaccessible since tooltips do not receive focus. If you need to include focusable content like buttons or links, consider using the overlay component.

## Styling

### Anatomy

<!--

  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  A visual anatomy diagram that shows the key parts or nested components that

  this component is made up of. They should be annotated with numbered badges in

  the diagram and a numbered list below the image should provide the names or

  explanations for each part.

-->

![Text alternative for component anatomy diagram](./path/to/anatomy.jpg)

1. Description of item in the anatomy badged with #1

2. Description of item in the anatomy badged with #2

3. ...

### Additional materials

<!--

  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  Add a bulleted list of links to additional, component-specific materials.

  Note that only publicly accessible pages can be linked to.
